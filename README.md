# MMF_AOVContactSheet
This is a Nuke tool that will allow you to extract all the AOVs from your image and create a contact sheet. You'll be able to select or deselect all the elements that you have.

The installation for this tool is going to be pretty simple:

- Save a copy of the AOV_ContactSheet.nk inside of your C:\Users\%your username%\.nuke\ToolSets
  - If you don't have the ToolSets folder, just create a new one.
- Once you are inside of nuke, you'll need to select the "other" tab that you have in the left-side menu shelf, go to "All plugins" and click on "Update".

In addition, I added the python code for some of the buttons that could be interesting to have a look in the buttons_code.py
